    <string name="case1_tv1">The ExceptionBuddy object was created within onCreate. with the following setup:\n\n
        ExceptionBuddy exceptionBuddy = \n\tnew ExceptionBuddy.Builder(this)
                                                \n\t.automaticallyInvokePostExceptionActivity(true)
                                                \n\t.setPostExceptionActivity(MyPostExceptionActivity.class)
                                                \n\t.withExceptionDirective(new Activity1aDirective())
                                                \n\t.build();\n\n
    Normally when an ExceptionBuddy object is constructed it will hang around to catch the uncaught exceptions, even if the activity is destroyed. However, when the android operating system needs to reclaim memory, it can destroy this object. Because of this, it is recommended to put this builder object in the automatically called method per component (for example: onCreate in an Activity, or onStartCommand for a service, or onReceive for a broadcast receiver.)</string>
